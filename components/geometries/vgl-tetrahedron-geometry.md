A component for generating a tetrahedron geometries., corresponding [THREE.TetrohedronGeometry](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/geometries/TetrohedronGeometry).

## Mixins
See the mixin components below for common properties.
* [VglGeometry](vgl-geometry)

## Properties
* `radius: float` - Radius of the tetrahedron.
* `detail: int` - Setting this to a value greater than 0 adds vertices making it no longer a tetrahedron.
