A light that gets emitted from a single point in all directions, corresponding [THREE.PointLight](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/lights/PointLight). A common use case for this is to replicate the light emitted from a bare lightbulb. This light can cast shadows.

## Mixins
See the mixin components below for common properties.
* [VglLight](vgl-light)

## Properties
